# - Escape to leave insert mode
# - C-l to clear the screen
# - a to re-enter insert mode
# Note: This only works with vi-mode editing ("set -o vi"), but not with emacs.
#bind-key C send-keys -R \; send-keys Escape C-l a \; clear-history
# To make it work for emacs (default) mode, we need to double the Escape, as a
# fast Escape C-l combination has no effect, but another Escape seems to cancel
# out the first. The literally inserted "a" can be cleaned via C-u (which also
# works for vi, and is a no-op on an empty new command-line, anyway). To avoid
# the beep on the already-empty command-line in vi-mode, just insert (another
# for emacs) character first.

# Duplicated to +/prefix\ +\ C ../../../../.tmux.conf
exec tmux send-keys -R \; send-keys Escape Escape C-l a a C-u \; clear-history
